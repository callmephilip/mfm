            "00:00:55 Sam Parr: Do did you ever even watch that show?\n",
            "00:00:57 Shaan Puri: Never watched it.\n",

            "01:20:48 Sam Parr: Uh but we would have lines out the door because at the time this show, we were it was like David Letterman was number one and then like American Pickers was number two in terms of the most watched shows on TV.\n",
            "01:31:49 Sam Parr: There'd be days where we would sell, I'm not exaggerating, $100,000 in American Pickers t-shirts because all these guys would come in and want to buy anything that was American Pickers related.\n",
            "01:41:33 Shaan Puri: How much revenue do you think that store did overall?\n",
            "01:44:03 Sam Parr: I would imagine uh 10 million dollars, one location.\n",

            "02:19:45 Sam Parr: For some reason, the picking culture, it's all like Hillbillies and like rural Alabama.\n",
            "02:24:33 Shaan Puri: I like how you said for some reason.\n",
            "02:26:52 Sam Parr: Yeah, I don't know.\n",
